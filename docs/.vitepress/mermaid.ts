// Mermaid rendering, wired directly onto `mermaid` rather than through
// `vitepress-plugin-mermaid`.
//
// The plugin registers its component by rewriting VitePress's client entry to
// import mermaid eagerly. That pulls every diagram renderer it can lazily load --
// katex, sequence, gantt, C4, venn, and the rest -- into the entry's module graph,
// so VitePress emits `modulepreload` links for all of them on *every* page,
// including pages with no diagram at all. Registering the component
// asynchronously instead (see theme/index.ts) keeps mermaid in its own chunk.
//
// Its component also forces `theme: "dark"` whenever the page is dark, which
// overrides the themeVariables that make diagrams match the site palette. Between
// that and the eager import, the two pieces below -- a fence transform and a
// little Vite config -- are all that was worth borrowing, so they are spelled out
// here and the dependency is gone.

/**
 * Replaces ```mermaid fences with the <Mermaid> component.
 *
 * Passed straight to VitePress's `markdown.config`. The diagram source is
 * URL-encoded into an attribute: it is arbitrary multi-line text, and encoding
 * escapes the quotes and newlines that would otherwise break the template.
 * <Suspense> is what lets <Mermaid> be registered as an async component.

 * The aliases exist because these dependencies ship both CommonJS and ESM builds
 * and mermaid reaches for the CommonJS paths. The production build survives that
 * -- Rollup interops it -- but the dev server serves native ESM and fails with
 * "does not provide an export named 'default'".
 *
 * The list is every `dayjs/plugin/*` mermaid imports. It is one longer than the
 * equivalent list in `vitepress-plugin-mermaid`, which omits `duration` and so
 * breaks any gantt chart under `mise run docs:dev`. This site has no gantt today,
 * but the omission is the kind that only surfaces when someone adds one.
